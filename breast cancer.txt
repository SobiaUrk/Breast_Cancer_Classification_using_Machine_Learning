Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning models to classify whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the famous Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It is a beginner-friendly project to understand data preprocessing, visualization, and classification with supervised learning techniques.

Project Overview
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset (from sklearn.datasets).
Task: Binary classification (Benign = 0, Malignant = 1).
Goal: Predict cancer diagnosis using different ML algorithms.
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.

Steps Involved
Import Libraries – Load required Python libraries.
Load Dataset – Use scikit-learn's built-in dataset.
Data Preprocessing – Clean, encode, and prepare the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions and correlations.
Feature Scaling – Standardize features for better model performance.
Train-Test Split – Split dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training – Apply algorithms like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Model Evaluation – Compare models using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
