# Breast_Cancer_Classification_using_Machine_Learning
Project Overview:
A beginner-friendly machine learning project for classifying breast cancer tumors (benign or malignant) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It covers data preprocessing, visualization, model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), and evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix.
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset (from sklearn.datasets).
Task: Binary classification (Benign = 0, Malignant = 1).
Goal: Predict cancer diagnosis using different ML algorithms.
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
